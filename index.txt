NOTE: I created these myself, they may not be totally correct, and they
also may contain differences to the 'official' versions on purpose, in
case I play something differently. Take care of these when you use them.

If you are looking for examples, `lemon-tree` may serve as a good
general giutar example, and `ki-helyett-szeretsz` may serve as a good
example on how to describe custom chords.
